# ProjectsHubApp
An application written in React Native By Liel Levi.
The app consists of a main page which is a login page,
And an information page that displays an information card about the logged in user, and a list of projects.
The list of projects that can be sorted according to a number of different parameters.
For any question I would be happy to help,
Liel.
